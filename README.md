# üåü PyPlexitas

PyPlexitas is a Python script that is designed to create an open-source alternative to Perplexity AI, a tool that provides users with detailed answers to their queries by searching the web, extracting relevant content, and using advanced language models to generate responses.

The script operates by first taking a user‚Äôs query and using search engines like Bing or Google and GMAIL to find relevant web pages or e-mails. It then scrapes the content from these web pages or mails, processes the text into manageable chunks, and generates vector embeddings for these chunks. Vector embeddings are mathematical representations of text that allow for efficient searching and comparison of content. These embeddings are stored in a database, enabling quick retrieval of relevant information based on the user‚Äôs query.

Once the content is processed and stored, the script uses a language model to generate a detailed answer to the user‚Äôs query, using the information extracted from the web pages. This response is designed to be accurate and informative, drawing directly from the content found during the search process.

**Example:**
```bash
python PyPlexitas.py -q "When will the next model GPT-5 be released" -s 10 --engine google 
```

Expected Output:
```

Answering your query: When will the next model GPT-5 be released üôã

The release date for GPT-5 is currently expected to be sometime in mid-2024, likely during the summer, according to a report from Business Insider [1][2]. OpenAI representatives have not provided a specific release date, and the timeline may be subject to change depending on the duration of safety testing and other factors [1][2]. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has indicated that a major AI model will be released this year, but it is unclear whether it will be called GPT-5 or something else [1].

## Features
- **Web Search**: Perform web searches using Bing, Google, or Gmail APIs.
- **Content Scraping**: Scrape content from search results.
- **Embedding Generation**: Generate embeddings for content using OpenAI or Ollama models.
- **Question Answering**: Answer questions based on the scraped content.
- **Vector Database**: Use Qdrant for storing and querying embeddings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dkruyt/PyPlexitas.git
    cd PyPlexitas
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the Qdrant service using Docker:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Configuration
Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root. Use the provided `example.env` as a template:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```
Fill in your API keys and other necessary details in the `.env` file:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_CX`
- `BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`

## Getting API Keys

### OpenAI API Key
1. Sign up or log in to your [OpenAI account](https://www.openai.com/).
2. Go to the API section and generate a new API key.
3. Copy the API key and add it to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` field in your `.env` file.

### Google Custom Search API Key and CX
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Enable the Custom Search API in the API & Services library.
4. Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page and create an API key.
5. Copy the API key and add it to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` field in your `.env` file.
6. To get the Custom Search Engine (CX) ID, go to the [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/) page.
7. Create a new search engine or select an existing one.
8. Copy the Search Engine ID (CX) and add it to the `GOOGLE_CX` field in your `.env` file.

### Bing Search API Key
1. Sign up or log in to your [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
2. Create a new Azure resource for Bing Search v7.
3. Go to the Keys and Endpoint section to find your API key.
4. Copy the API key and add it to the `BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` field in your `.env` file.

### Gmail API Key
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Enable the Gmail API in the API & Services library.
4. Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page and create OAuth 2.0 credentials.
5. Download the credentials file and save it as `credentials.json` in the project root.

## Usage
